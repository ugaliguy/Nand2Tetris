# Nand2Tetris

This repository hold the project files for the the course (Build a Modern Computer from First Principles) [https://www.coursera.org/learn/build-a-computer/home/welcome].

**Project 1: Logic Gates** We build several elementary logic gates - e.g. Not, And, Or ... etc. - using a Nand gate.

**Project 2: Arithmetic Gates** We build the Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) from several simpler arithmetic gates constructed from the logic gates in **Project 1**.

**Project 3: Memory Gates** We build a Random Access Memory (RAM) unit from primitive DFF gates.

**Project 4: Machine Language Programming** We write two assembler programs - one for multiplaction of two nonnegative integers with product &lt;= 2^15 (32768), the other for low-level I/O.
